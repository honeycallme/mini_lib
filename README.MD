Warning: some functions are not fully tested, and may not work as expected.

(basic functions do have full functionnalities)

## Printf function
Reproduction the printf function from the C library, with the following flags:

<details><summary>implemented flags</summary>

- [x] %d
- [x] %i
- [x] %c
- [x] %s
- [x] %o
- [x] %x
- [x] %X
- [x] %p
- [x] %b
- [x] %p
- [x] %S
- [x] %u
- [x] %f
- [x] %l

</details>

Supports the following formats as well :
- [x] '#'
- [x] ' '

Works perfeclty fine for one argument, but may not work as expected for multiple arguments.
This WILL get updated in the future.

## Usage
Reminder its a -42 for epitech students copying this code, so use it at your 
own risk.

(its also old code for the most which i'm really not proud of)

use in a terminal :

`make` to compile the library

`make clean` to compile and clean the library

`make re` to recompile and clean the library
